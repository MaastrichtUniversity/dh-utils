   Examples
   ```
    ./irodsMigrateUserRole.sh -m "file" 
    ./irodsMigrateUserRole.sh -m "file" -f "mapping.txt" 
    ./irodsMigrateUserRole.sh -m "file" -f "mapping.txt" -d "false"
    
    ./irodsMigrateUserRole.sh -m "user" -u "m.coonen@maastrichtuniversity.nl" -n "mcoonen"
    ./irodsMigrateUserRole.sh -m "user" -u "m.coonen@maastrichtuniversity.nl" -n "mcoonen" -d "false" 
   ```
